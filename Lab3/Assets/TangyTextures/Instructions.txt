TangyTextures is a node-based procedural material generator for Unity. 

We recommend you to visit our homepage http://www.lemonspawn.com for tutorials and documentation.

Example materials are located under Assets/TangyTextures/Data/Textures, but can be placed anywhere you desire.

To start TangyTextures, select Window/LemonSpawn/TangyTextyres and dock the editor window / material preview window at a suitable place. 

First, pan the window by shift+click+drag anywhere on the canvas. 

Right-click to add nodes, such as heightmap generators etc. Connect nodes with same colours. If the node system is compilable (the box is green), 
materials are automatically generated and displayed in the preview window. If the system suddenly has a problem and doesn't compile, you can force calculation by 
pressing the "force calculate" button. If you happened to start compiling a complex material, you can always abort the current calculation with the "Abort" button.

If TangyTextures starts acting weird (sluggish etc), press "play" and "stop" to recompile / restart the system.

We strongly encourage you to check out the tutorials at lemonspawn.com! 

NOTE: TangyTextures is still in development. If you find any bugs, have comments or suggestions, don't hesitate contacting us! Also, if you
happen to use materials created with TangyTextures in a published product, please let us know - would be cool to see :)

And as ever, thanks for buying!
